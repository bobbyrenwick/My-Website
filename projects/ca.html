						<h2>Description</h2>
					</div>
					<p>Creative Action were a digital agency with offices in London, Singapore and Japan. Upon taking up employment with them, my first task was to create a brand and apply that to print and digital materials. We needed a logo that was striking, but not overpowering that would allow customers to instantly gain perspective on our approach to our work. As a group of creatives we were daring, but rooted in strong client relations and being a primarily digital studio, we had a foundation in designing for user experience. The result was a dynamic logo that portrays an ethos of clean simple design with a playful, creative streak. Creative Action were subsequently bought by InnoCellence.</p>
