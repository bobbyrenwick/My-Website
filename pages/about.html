					<p>I am a designer, illustrator and fledgling front-end developer currently working at InnoCellence based in London, England. I work with a large range of clients, from Fortune 500 companies to small boutiques and individuals. No matter the size of the client I always attack every brief or business problem with the same ethos of being "less ordinary"; striving to find solutions that are different from the norm and challenge establised ideas and practises.<br/><br/>
					I have accrued a wide range of skills over the years and am now proficient at both digital design and print design. Recently I've taken to the delights of the development world and am currently in the process of learning the essential web languages.</br></br>

					I graduated Chelsea College of Art and Design in 2010 with an Honours Degree in Graphic Design and Communication. If you'd like more info please <a>download</a> my CV.
